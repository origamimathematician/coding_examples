This is a simplified simulation of the mechanics of granular materials in
an hourglass. It is a two dimensional simulation and currently does not
implement rotaional forces (hence it is a simplified model). Much of the 
current implementation is setup to include force calculations in a third 
dimesion. A 3-D simulation could easily be implimented in the future given
a good visualization package. 

Note: current version needs to be cleaned up and commented. Gains in
efficency are probably possible as well. In particular, the pariwise
distance calculations of particles in the system could probably be improved.
