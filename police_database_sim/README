This is a python program that is a simple simulation of a police database of criminals and criminal infractions. It is completely automated
and all data and timestamps are generated randomly. It was created to demostrate the use of random number generation in python and as a simple
use case of a binary search tree data structure. Please note that bst.py is NOT mine. It was implemented by Brad Miller for use with the 
"Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms in Python" book. I used it as part of class project.
